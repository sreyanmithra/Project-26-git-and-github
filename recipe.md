HOW TO MAKE PANNER BUTTER MASALA:

* Step-1 : Prepare the tomato-cashew nut gravy

To prepare this easy paneer recipe, take a pan and melt ghee in it. Once the ghee is melted, add ginger garlic paste and saute these ingredients for half a minute. Then add tomato puree in it. Stir well and then add cashew nut paste along with red chilli powder and salt. Mix well and cook for 2 minutes.

* Step-2 : Cook paneer in this gravy for 2 minutes

Now, add honey, kasoori methi powder, butter in the gravy and mix well. Cook for 2-3 minutes and then add paneer pieces in it. Stir gently and coat the gravy well over the paneer pieces.

* Step-3 : Garnish with fresh cream and serve Paneer Butter Masala hot

Add fresh cream (keep 1 tbsp aside) in the gravy along with 1/2 tsp chaat masala. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Your Paneer Butter Masala is ready! Garnish with remaining fresh cream and chaat masala. Serve Paneer Butter Masala hot with paratha, rotis or rice!

* Tips :
Homemade paneer works best for this recipe. If you are using store-bought paneer, try to soak it in warm water for 10-15 minutes.
If you have more time, add 1/2 cup chopped onion and 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes in the first step and then blend the mixture.
Strain and blend the residue again in the blender while preparing the gravy for enhanced smoothness.
If you prefer a spicier gravy, add 2 tsp green chilli paste or extra red chilli powder.
